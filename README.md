GenericTestMod
======
This project is designed to show off random things you can do in modded Minecraft.

This contains the basic forge example mod provided with the mdk.

## Got a suggestion?
Feel free to open an issue, pull request or ping me on discord. I am always open to learn more or improve my code style
and depending on how much time I have will be making possibly some tutorials based off the code here, so I would like to
keep it up to date with best practices to use as a good example.

## Got an issue?
Not my problem. These examples are here for you to learn from or have fun with.
While you can get help from large portions of the community quite easily if you ask a stupid question you are going to get a stupid answer.
Try to solve it yourself else you will never learn.

If you don't know Java you are going to struggle, learning this way is not an ideal way to learn from scratch.
Though playing with other peoples projects or altering existing code may help you, don't expect to instantly be able to make a lot of new content.

### Examples
 * Ore Generation  
 * Feature Generation  
 * Custom Features  
 * AccessTransformers  
 * JSCoreMod (Though with custom help to make it more readable) - [Good reference for example scripts without](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/CoreMods/tree/e6fed88bfcb29bc062c04310f18ebe2777582d03/src/test/javascript)

# Examples to make
 * New creative tabs

### Not fully supported examples
**Forge Mixins** - Using possibly outdated setup. See below notice

## Mixins Notice
Mixins are now being officially included. I will update the examples when I get the time to demonstrate updated setup.

# Other mods to look at
As most of the time I am spending on hobby projects will be going into making other modding projects I will link other mods
I am working on for examples with summaries of what they include. Though for anything experimental I will likely keep adding
examples to here.

## Will you do fabric examples?
For now no, though there is a lot of help on the fabric discord https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv
